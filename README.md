Bridges, bots, and other tooling requested by community members. Anyone is welcome to start working on the list, leave a link to your GitHub repo on the idea so it can be closed as "started"!

# Label Legend

* `easy` - Weekend/day project
* `medium` - A week or two to complete
* `hard` - Requires extensive knowledge or will take a while to complete

Ideas with multiple labels are the average of the two. For example, `easy medium` means "between easy and medium".
